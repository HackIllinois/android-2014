HackIllinois Android
====================

This is the Android app for HackIllinois

Protips:

-   Do not delete the gradle-wrapper.properties file!
-   Before pushing commits, make sure that files don't have merge conflicts like <<<<<< and ======= and >>>>>>>
-   Do not concatenate strings with the + operator! Angrave will hunt you down!

#We are now supporting gingerbread (api level 9+)#
So make sure you check the Build.Version before calling newer methods and have a graceful fallback!
